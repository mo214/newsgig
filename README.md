# News Site

This project is a simple news site that displays the latest news articles. It is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, providing a seamless experience for users to read and interact with news content.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that contains the structure of the webpage, including the header, main content area for news articles, and footer.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles dynamic functionalities such as fetching news articles, updating the DOM, and managing user interactions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the news site.
3. Optionally, you can modify `style.css` to change the appearance of the site or `script.js` to add more functionalities.

## Usage Guidelines

- The news site is designed to be responsive and should work on various devices.
- Users can navigate through the articles and interact with any dynamic features implemented in `script.js`.
